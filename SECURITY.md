## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities must be reported **in English** via email.  
Send detailed reports to: **neoaichan@hotmail.com**

Include reproduction steps, affected versions, and impact analysis.  
Initial assessment is typically completed within 48 hours. Confirmed issues proceed through a coordinated disclosure process; non-qualifying reports are closed with a brief technical explanation.
